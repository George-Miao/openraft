-   Fixed: [8b62c797](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/8b62c797b343df5f496dc1b7c0264d09229e3b4a) Immediate response when snapshot installation is unnecessary; by 张炎泼; 2024-05-05

    When `Engine::handle_install_full_snapshot()` is called and the provided
    snapshot is not up-to-date, the snapshot should not be installed, and
    the response should be sent back immediately. Previously, the method
    might delay the response unnecessarily, waiting for an installation
    process that would not proceed.

    This commit adjusts the logic so that if the snapshot is recognized as
    outdated, it immediately returns a `None` `Condition`, ensuring the
    caller is informed straightaway that no installation will occur.
