### Added:

-   Added: [8b54a80f](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/8b54a80f6e5b06a181f12f55179e0928a470e21b) `Raft::config()` returns a ref to Config this raft node uses; by 张炎泼; 2024-03-14

-   Added: [7d5326ce](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/7d5326ce7b5534c93300eabbcefa0c4d3d45284e) add `RaftMetrics::millis_since_quorum_ack`; by 张炎泼; 2024-03-15

    `RaftMetrics::millis_since_quorum_ack` is the interval in milliseconds
    since the last timestamp a quorum acknowledged.

    This duration is used by the application to assess the likelihood that
    the leader has lost synchronization with the cluster.
    A longer duration without acknowledgment may suggest a higher
    probability of the leader being partitioned from the cluster.

    Update the example to return unreachable error for connection errors to
    prevent immediate retries.

    Previously, the heartbeat results were not sent back to
    `RaftCore`, which requires these results to calculate the **last
    timestamp acknowledged by a quorum**.

    This commit resolves the issue by ensuring that the heartbeat RPC
    results are sent back to `RaftCore`, allowing it to correctly update the
    **last timestamp acknowledged by a quorum**.

    This commit addresses an issue where `RaftMetrics` could be sent before
    `RaftDataMetrics` and `RaftServerMetrics`. Since `Wait` relies solely on
    `RaftMetrics` to reflect the latest state, it is crucial that
    `RaftMetrics` are dispatched only after the other two metrics have been
    updated. This change guarantees that once a change in `RaftMetrics` is
    detected, it accurately represents the most recent changes from both
    `RaftDataMetrics` and `RaftServerMetrics`.
