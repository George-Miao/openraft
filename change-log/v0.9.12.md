    This commit adds the `RaftLogReader::limited_get_log_entries()` method,
    which enables applications to fetch log entries that are equal to or
    smaller than a specified range. This functionality is particularly
    useful for customizing the size of AppendEntries requests at the storage
    API level.

    - Applications can now decide the number of log entries to return based
      on the input range. If the application determines that the requested
      log entries range is too large for a single RPC, it can opt to return
      only the first several requested log entries instead of the full
      range.

    - The method provides a default implementation that delegates the
      operation to `RaftLogReader::try_get_log_entries`.

    This enhancement allows for more flexible and efficient handling of log
    entries, particularly in scenarios where network constraints or
    performance considerations require smaller data transfers.
