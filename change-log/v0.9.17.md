### Improved:

-   Improved: [536a435e](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/536a435e2fccc98c37a776322d0f7e4aba26c179) Chunk read log entry and check range on startup; by 张炎泼; 2024-09-14

    - Implement chunk-based reading of committed log entries when
      re-applying to state machine upon startup.

    - Add validation for log entry indexes, to avoid applying wrong entries
      to state machine.

-   Improved: [dc18dc6f](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/dc18dc6f5fed49c1a4717133fbc489eb57efda79) remove `Copy` bound from `NodeId`; by 张炎泼; 2024-10-14

    The `NodeId` type is currently defined as:

    ```rust
    type NodeId: .. + Copy + .. + 'static;
    ```

    This commit removes the `Copy` bound from `NodeId`.
    This modification will allow the use of non-`Copy` types as `NodeId`,
    providing greater flexibility for applications that prefer
    variable-length strings or other non-`Copy` types for node
    identification.

    This change maintain compatibility by updating derived `Copy`
    implementations with manual implementations:

    ```rust
    // Before
    #[derive(Copy...)]
    pub struct LogId<NID: NodeId> {}

    // After
    impl<NID: Copy> Copy for LogId<NID> {}
    ```
