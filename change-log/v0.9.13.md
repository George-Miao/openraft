-   Added: [fb49efb3](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/fb49efb37e209ab0cd9ea7c4bc243f18f4e9a658) Add `DecomposeResult` to simplify error handling; by 张炎泼; 2024-06-20

    This commit treats remote errors occurring during RPC, like a `Fatal`
    error, as an `Unreachable` error. This is due to Openraft's current
    inability to distinguish between an unreachable node and a broken node.

    - **Helper trait `DecomposeResult`:** Introduced to simplify handling
      composite errors. It converts a result of the
      form `Result<R, ErrorAOrB>`
      into a nested result `Result<Result<R, ErrorA>, ErrorB>`.
