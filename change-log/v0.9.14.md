    This commit addresses an issue in the vote updating mechanism during the
    handling of `RequestVote` responses. Previously, encountering a higher
    `vote` in a response incorrectly led to an update of the local
    `state.vote`, which could break Raft consistency rules.

    **Issue Description:**
    - A higher `vote` seen in a `RequestVote` response does not necessarily
      mean that the vote is granted. The local `state.vote` should only be
      updated if the vote is actually granted, i.e., the responding node has
      a higher `vote` and a `last_log_id` that allows it to become a leader.

    **Resolution:**
    - The local `state.vote` will no longer be updated upon merely seeing a
      higher `vote` in the `RequestVote` response. Instead, this higher vote
      will be recorded in `last_seen_vote` for consideration in the next
      election cycle, without updating the current `state.vote`.

    This commit introduces a new trait, `TypeConfigExt`, which extends
    `RaftTypeConfig`. The purpose of this trait is to simplify the access to
    various functionalities provided by the `RaftTypeConfig` trait,
    enhancing code readability and reducing complexity.

    **Methods Added to `TypeConfigExt`:**
    - `now()`
    - `sleep()`
    - `sleep_until()`
    - `timeout()`
    - `timeout_at()`
    - `oneshot()`
    - `spawn()`

    **Usage Improvement:**
    - Instead of using the
      `<<C as RaftTypeConfig>::AsyncRuntime as AsyncRuntime>::Instant::now()`,
      you can now simply call `C::now()`.
