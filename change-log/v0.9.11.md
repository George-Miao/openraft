### Fixed:

-   Fixed: [30cdf5fb](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/30cdf5fbc9275ce6213ca8f70cf37bc0c6fe957a) New leader must flush blank log; by 张炎泼; 2024-05-14

    This commit addresses a critical issue where if a new leader does not
    flush the blank log to disk upon becoming established and then restarts
    immediately, there is a possibility that previously committed data
    becomes invisible to readers.

    Before the blank log is flushed, the leader (identified by vote `v3`)
    assumes it will be flushed and commits this log once (|quorum|-1)
    replication responses are received. If the blank log is lost and the
    server is restarted, data committed by a new leader (vote `v2`) may
    not be visible.

    This issue is addressed by utilizing `LeaderHandler::leader_append_entries()`
    instead of `ReplicationHandler::append_blank_log()`, where the former
    does not wait for the blank log to flush.

    Changes:

    - When assigning log IDs to log entries, the `Leading.last_log_id`,
      which represents the state of the log proposer (equivalent term in
      Paxos is Proposer), should be used instead of `RaftState.last_log_id`,
      which represents the state of the log receiver (equivalent term in
      Paxos is Acceptor).

    - Consequently, the method `assign_log_ids()` has been moved from
      `RaftState` to `Leading`.

    - Avoid manual implementation of duplicated logic:

      - During `initialize()`, reuse `FollowingHandler::do_append_entries()`
        to submit the very first log to storage.

      - In `establish_leader()`, reuse
        `LeaderHandler::leader_append_entries()` to submit log to storage
        and remove `ReplicationHandler::append_blank_log()`.

      - Remove `Command::AppendEntry`.
