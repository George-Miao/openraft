-   Fixed: [2d6441a1](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/2d6441a1a5dbfad0261df1794d2ebbe0eea0f715) Prevent panic when calling `Raft::change_membership()` on uninitialized node; by 张炎泼; 2024-09-05

    Previously, `change_membership()` assumed the current membership config was
    always non-empty and used the last config entry. However, uninitialized
    nodes lack a membership config, leading to panics.

    This commit adds checks to prevent `change_membership()` from panicking
