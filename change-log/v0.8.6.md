### Fixed:

-   Fixed: [63e69b9a](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/63e69b9a119c148b9e542eb2ec8e9c5cf763737a) restore replication progress when a leader starts up (#884); by 张炎泼; 2023-06-29

    As a leader, the replication progress to itself should be restored upon
    startup.

    And if this leader is the only node in a cluster, it should re-apply all
    of the logs to state machine at once.

    - Fix: #883

-   Fixed: [c7725c79](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/c7725c79d867334305030ad288be100addf91c30) Do not report snapshot.last_log_id to metrics until snapshot is finished building/installing; by 张炎泼; 2023-10-18

    Before this commit `RaftMetrics.snapshot` contains the last log id of a
    snapshot that is **going** to install. Therefore there is chance the
    metrics is updated but the store does not.

    In this commit, `RaftMetrics.snapshot` will only be updated when a
    snapshot is finished building or installing, by adding a new field
    `snpashot` to `IOState` for tracking persisted snapshot meta data.

    - Fix: #912

    When streaming a snapshot chunk, it should repeatly `read_buf()` until
    `snapshot_max_chunk_size` is full or read EOF.

-   Fixed: [2c715d6e](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/2c715d6e6673a11e96ea157509aefc42e1438330) End `tick_loop()` when the receiver is gone.; by Ivan Schréter; 2023-11-13

    Currently, `tick_loop()` would keep printing the trace message every
    tick even when the receiver (Raft main loop) is gone in this form:

    `INFO openraft::core::tick: .../tick.rs:70: Tick fails to send, receiving end quit: channel closed`

    If the tick message fails to send, then terminate the loop, since every
    future message will fail to send as well.

    Also adjust the trace message to better describe what happened.
