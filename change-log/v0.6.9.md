### Dependency:

-   Dependency: [a97a3097](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/a97a3097b56078e3dc20aa29df1fff07090792cd) adapt rust stable-1.63 and nightly 2022-08-11; by 张炎泼; 2022-09-02

    - `std::backtrace` is stabilized in stable-1.63;
    - `std::Error::backtrace()` is replaced with provider style API in
      nightly.

    Since `std::Error` API now is different in stable and nightly, it's not
    possible any more to use `--feature bt` with stable toolchain.

### Fixed:

-   Fixed: [d5b52d35](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/d5b52d35d35643a6039b75039e81c78298b74758) snapshot with smaller last_log_id than last_applied should not be installed; by 张炎泼; 2022-08-25

    Otherwise, the state machine will revert to an older state, while the
    in-memory `last_applied` is unchanged.
    This finally causes logs that falls in range `(snapshot.last_log_id, last_applied]` can not be applied.
