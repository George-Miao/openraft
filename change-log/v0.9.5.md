-   Added: [e4fed706](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/e4fed7066ce3f941717285a15de5894c505cb5b1) Add `Raft::is_initialized()`; by 张炎泼; 2024-04-08

    `Raft::is_initialized()` returns `true` if this raft node is already
    initialized with `Raft::initialize()`, by checking if log is empty and
    `vote` is not written.

    This commit introduces the `Responder` trait that defines the mechanism
    by which `RaftCore` sends responses back to the client after processing
    write requests.  Applications can now customize response handling by
    implementing their own version of the `RaftTypeConfig::Responder` trait.

    The `Responder::from_app_data(RaftTypeConfig::D)` method is invoked to
    create a new `Responder` instance when a client write request is
    received.
    Once the write operation is completed within `RaftCore`,
    `Responder::send(WriteResult)` is called to dispatch the result
    back to the client.

    By default, `RaftTypeConfig::Responder` retains the existing
    functionality using a oneshot channel, ensuring backward compatibility.

    This change is non-breaking, requiring no modifications to existing
    applications.

    - Fix: #1068

-   Added: [c508a354](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/c508a3540331b5ea08d75b09dfc7a90a87c93b89) `Raft::client_write_ff()` ff for fire-and-forget; by 张炎泼; 2024-04-08

    `Raft<C>::client_write_ff() -> C::Responder::Receiver` submit a client
    request to Raft to update the state machine, returns an application
    defined response receiver `Responder::Receiver` to receive the response.

    `_ff` means fire and forget.

    It is same as [`Raft::client_write`] but does not wait for the response.
    When using this method, it is the application's responsibility for
    defining mechanism building and consuming the `Responder::Receiver`.
